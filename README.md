# **Becoming a Responsible AI Inspector: A Mini Blog Investigation üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

As a responsible AI inspector, my job is to analyze how AI systems are used, spot problems, and suggest improvements. Today, I‚Äôll explore **two practical real-world cases**.

---

## **Case 1: Bank Credit AI**

**What‚Äôs happening:**
A bank uses AI to approve loans. The AI analyzes historical customer data to decide whether someone gets credit or not.

**Problem:**

* The AI rejects applications more often from people living in historically disadvantaged neighborhoods.
* There is no transparency about which factors weigh most in the decision.
* It may perpetuate social inequalities (implicit bias).

**Improvement idea:**

* Conduct regular bias audits.
* Clearly explain the reasons for decisions to customers and allow appeals.
* Train the AI with more diverse and ethical data.

## **Case 2: Video Interview Recruitment AI**

**What‚Äôs happening:**
A company uses AI to analyze recorded interviews. The system evaluates candidates based on facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures.

**Problem:**

* People with strong accents or different cultural expressions are penalized.
* It may discriminate against neurodivergent candidates or candidates of different ethnicities.
* Lack of accountability: no one reviews the AI‚Äôs decisions.

**Improvement idea:**

* Use AI only as a support tool, not as the final decision-maker.
* Train AI on diverse cultural and communication patterns.
* Include human review for all hiring decisions.

## **Mini Blog Conclusion:**

AI is powerful but can amplify injustices if used carelessly. Being a responsible inspector means **detecting bias, demanding transparency, and putting ethics first**.

üí° **Quick summary:**

* Always question *how* AI makes decisions.
* Always check *who is affected*.
* Always implement *human review*.
